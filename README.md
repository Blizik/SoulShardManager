## SoulShardManager

Keeps your inventory from filling up with soul shards when you're leveling a Warlock and taking advantage of [Improved Drain Soul](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=18372). 

### Installation
* Download .zip
* Extract .zip to /Interface/Addons/
* Rename to remove "-master" from the folder name

### Usage
Type `/soulshardmanager <number>` or `/ssm <number>` to set the number of soul shards to keep in the inventory. By default the number to keep is 28, the number of slots in a Core Felcloth Bag.

Only updates on xp or honor gain, which has the nice side effect of not destroying the extra shard you get when your pet gets unsummoned from range or death.
